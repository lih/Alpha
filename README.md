Alpha is a simple programming language, whose compiler is written in Haskell (maybe later
versions will be written in Alpha).

For more documentation, I invite you to visit the [Alpha Lang Website][alpha-lang]

In order to compile Alpha, you will need the 'cabal-install' tool. Then you will just have
to execute the following commands to compile the project:

    cabal configure --user
    cabal install
