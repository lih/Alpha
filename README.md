Welcome to Alpha !
==================

Alpha is a simple programming language, whose compiler is written in Haskell (although
later versions might be written in Alpha).

For more information about the language itself, I invite you to visit the [Alpha Lang
Website][alpha-lang]

Compiling Alpha
---------------

In order to compile Alpha, you will need the 'cabal-install' tool for building Haskell
projects. Using cabal-install, you will just have to execute the following commands (in
the project root directory) to compile the compiler:

    cabal configure --user
    cabal install
